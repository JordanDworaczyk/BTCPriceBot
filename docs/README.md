# How it works

EthPriceBot is a twitterbot that pulls price information from
[coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) via
[cryptowat.ch](https://cryptowat.ch/coinbase/ethusd/1d). It then uses
[plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) to plot the price data and save it as a
picture to be tweeted by [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) every hour.
