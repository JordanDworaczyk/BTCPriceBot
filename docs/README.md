Pricebots is a way to automatically tweet the price of crypto-currencies on Twitter.
---

# How it works

Our bots pull price information from
[cryptowat.ch](https://cryptowat.ch). They then use
[plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) to plot the price data and save
it as a picture to be tweeted using [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
every hour.

Each status tweeted provides a 24hr summary of the price-action on a single
exchange. The chart that Pricebots provides represents the weekly price action
, of the crypto-currency, with each candle representing an hour of
price movement. The charts looks a little something like this:

Ethereum Pricebot | Bitcoin Pricebot
------------ | -------------

Every hour, a new candle is added to the chart, and a new 24hr summary is
tweeted. _Feel free to follow our Pricebots. You can see them down below!_
