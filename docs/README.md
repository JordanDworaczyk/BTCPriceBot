# How it works
Pulls price information from [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) via [crytowat.ch](https://cryptowat.ch/coinbase/ethusd/1d), then uses [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) to make a twitter post every hour. 

**Note:**
Plotly and Tweepy are required to run the bot. Install using `pip` for Python2.7.
